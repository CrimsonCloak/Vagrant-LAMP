# Vagrant-LAMP 
Vagrant files setting up a LAMP stack in an Ubuntu VM.

## Structure and setup

This repository contains all relevant files for setting up a LAMP-stack in a VirtbualBox-VM using Vagrant. The LAMP-stack in question consists of an Apache webserver, a MariaDB database and PHP for serving dynamic content to the webserver. This stack will be served on an Ubuntu OS. 

The main idea behind this project is having some initial entries in the database consisting of fictional names. Using PHP, we can interact with the MariaDB database using SQL-statements. In the end we will have a basic implementation of all the CRUD-methods (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
