    <h1>Welcome to my LAMP stack!</h1>
    <p>This project is an implementation of the LAMP-stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), hosted on a VM and configured using Vagrant. Please note that in lieu of MySQL, we use MariaDB (which functions mostly exactly the same for this project). In addition, the PHP-code used in this project does not follow best practices nor is it particularly secure. This is merely experimentation and definitely not intended for use in a production environment.</p>

    <h1>Definition of LAMP</h1>

    <p>LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) is an acronym denoting one of the most common software stacks for many of the web's most popular applications. However, LAMP now refers to a generic software stack model and its components are largely interchangeable.
        The components of the LAMP stack are present in the software repositories of most Linux distributions (source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">Wikipedia</a>)
        Each letter in the acronym stands for one of its four open-source building blocks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Linux for the operating system</li>
            <li>Apache HTTP Server</li>
            <li>MySQL for the relational database management system</li>
            <li>PHP, Perl, or Python programming language</li>

        </ul>
